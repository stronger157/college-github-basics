# GitHub Basics for College Projects

## Introduction
Learning GitHub is essential for college projects because it provides version control and allows multiple people to collaborate effectively. It helps students track changes in code, manage different versions of a project, and work together on team projects. GitHub also offers a way to organize and document work, making it easier to share and review code.

## My Goals with GitHub
- Learn the basics of Git version control (commits, branches, merges).
- Work effectively with classmates on group projects using GitHub.
- Understand and use GitHub's issue tracking and pull requests.
- Improve my understanding of how open-source projects are managed.

## Steps Iâ€™ll Take to Get Comfortable with GitHub
1. Set up a GitHub profile and create a new repository.
2. Learn basic Git commands like `git clone`, `git add`, `git commit`, and `git push`.
3. Start collaborating on small projects with classmates.
4. Explore branching and merging workflows.
5. Practice resolving merge conflicts and using pull requests.
